How to solve problems

algorithms
builds a set of rules that allow us to solve a problem using an engineering aproach
a sequence of instuctions that are designed to perform a task eg. cooking recipe
instuctions must be precise 

thing we can consider with code 
- variables (what do i have access to an chat can i create, number, strings, objects) their names and types
- inputs, where they are coming from an what they are going to be
- output, return statements, console.log, the thing that we want to see
- the things i need to do with that stuff, behaviours i want my function to do

breaking problem down
write function that takes a list of numbers
returns as a list, if number is prime it will have "prime"
and if not 'an array with the divisor'

input array with numbers
output array with strings or arrays
how to check number is prime
how to find the divisors
have an array to put stuff in

steps to solve
-have an understanding of the problem
-consider, inputs, outputs, variables we might need and the behaviors of the functions
-focus on the simple cases first
-talk about the steps in english/psuedo code and talking it through with pair
-break the problem down into further functions (abstracting)

filter(callbackFn) function is used as an argument

problem solving

documentation
what it is - guide provided by the devs of a particular function to provide details of what that function does and how to use it
eg, mdn - javascript
nodejs.org - node website
devdocs.io - has js docs, same data sa mdn and others but in different format, easier to navigate
documentation is detailed instruction manual, should be used instead of guessing

how to find what you need, skip over pieces that are not relevent,

undestanding through experimentation, use the code you have found and see what happens and adapt it


joes DE talk

presenting data correctly, buisness inteliegence tools, give data to data scientists, display data in graph
data can be repackaged and sent out via api's
DE's will build all that infrastructure
extract data, transform and load
setup tools for others to analise data
secure data

data scientist are concerned witht he insights of the data, will they get more sales, how many sales etc.
DE's prepare the data for them, getting the info contained in the data

volume of data is huge, getting bigger all the time
variety of data is larger, images/sound files/sensor information(alexa, siri, google)
more sources of information
lots of tools for data engineers
velocity, has to be delivered fast

DE's will be softweare engineers and knowledge of data structures and how to build in the back end


high demand skillset

need to know.
coding
programming
python - packages, pandas, requests, boto 3 for interacting with AWS
java
scala
go
rust

data modeling, reorganising data for analytical uses

cloud operations (AWS, Google, Azure) must be deploy in desireable fashion

machine learing
visulisation packages
security
real time data streaming
data validation

3 core skills, coding, data management, cloud infrastructure
