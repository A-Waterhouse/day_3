How to solve problems

algorithms
builds a set of rules that allow us to solve a problem using an engineering aproach
a sequence of instuctions that are designed to perform a task eg. cooking recipe
instuctions must be precise 

thing we can consider with code 
- variables (what do i have access to an chat can i create, number, strings, objects) their names and types
- inputs, where they are coming from an what they are going to be
- output, return statements, console.log, the thing that we want to see
- the things i need to do with that stuff, behaviours i want my function to do

breaking problem down
write function that takes a list of numbers
returns as a list, if number is prime it will have "prime"
and if not 'an array with the divisor'

input array with numbers
output array with strings or arrays
how to check number is prime
how to find the divisors
have an array to put stuff in

steps to solve
-have an understanding of the problem
-consider, inputs, outputs, variables we might need and the behaviors of the functions
-focus on the simple cases first
-talk about the steps in english/psuedo code and talking it through with pair
-break the problem down into further functions (abstracting)
